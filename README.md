# maven-space-challenge

My python (and an additional css file, which belongs in an subfolder) used for ETL in the Maven Space challenge.
I used pandas en numpy to do the cleaning up and create dataframes to visualize.

At some moment I decided to do the visualization in Power BI, hence a few exports, but after the submission I decided that it was useful to do the dash/plotly configuration too for learning purposes.


Result in the local browser:
